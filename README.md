# Battleship Game

- This is a command line, text-only game to simulate battleship against an easy computer opponent
- The game is played between 2 players, who each have a 10x10 grid with rows A-J and columns 1-10
- Ships are all 1 square wide and the player gets 1 each of length 2 (Small), 3 (Medium), 4 (Large), and 5 (Giant).
- Upon program start the computer lays out the ships for both players. Ships can only be horizontal or vertical and
  cannot intersect.
- The players alternate turns and pick a coordinate to fire upon during each turn.
- After the user selects a square, the computer informs them of the result. If the square has no ship, it was a miss. If
  the square has a ship that has not been hit, it was a hit. When the user hits all the squares of the ship, they have
  sunk the ship. When they have sunk all the opponentsâ€™ ships, they win.
